And he said , Mama , I 'm home .
He called his mom as soon as the school bus dropped him off .
He didn 't say a word .
He told his mom he had gotten home .
I didn 't know what I was going for or anything , so was to report to a designated place in Washington .
I have never been to Washington so when I was assigned there I got lost trying to find the place .
I knew exactly what I needed to do as I marched to Washington .
I was not quite certain what I was going to do so I went to Washington where I was assigned to report .
He didn 't get to go .
He was the first to be invited and enjoyed the experience .
He wasn 't allowed to attend .
He wasn 't allowed to go to the museum 's opening .
And I was like OK , and that was it !
After I said yes , it ended .
I said no and it dragged on and on .
When I said yes , we decided that we would get married that day .
I was just there just trying to figure it out .
I understood it well from the beginning .
I was trying to understand where the money went .
I was trying to understand .
And , uh , they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just , just determined that they were going to be white .
They continued to visit every day .
They didn 't visit the family anymore .
They stopped visiting the family when the racial tensions started .
And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister 's husband decided that they were going to move to the city , to Augusta , and pass for white .
Granny 's Sister was white and moved to Texas .
Granny 's sister was not white .
Granny 's sister wasn 't white but she wanted to be so she could go to school .
Michael Santo of , of Firewell and Company , of Buffalo , NY , they was the one that uh , manufactured , uh , invented the high O2 regulator before that they built fire control on the stove well .
Santo lived in New York and worked on the high O2 regulator .
Santo specialized in fire safety because it was an issue that was dear to him .
Santo worked for Disney and operated the tea cups .
But he was , you know , in a lot of ways , just like a plantation owner 's son because he was the son of this guy who owned a lot of property .
His dad had never owned anything in his life .
His dad owned 2000 acres of farmland .
His dad owned a lot of property .
But my job was to put parachutes on it and life preservers when we would load it and start to an overseas location .
I didn 't have a job so I just kept all the boxes at home .
I shipped the boxes to Japan .
I shipped them out .
Now that 's how , uh , I stay buckled in .
I made sure the buckle was on tight so I would be safe .
That is exactly how I was unhooked .
That is precisely how I was fastened in .
And he was a philanderer , an d oh yeah , he was like out there . And , ah , so , you know , I didn 't like him , but anyway those are my stories .
He was so faithful and nice .
I hated him because he was so arrogant .
I wasn 't a fan of his .
When I pull , when he pulls the canopy for me to start getting him out , he points to two instruments on the left side of the aircraft that had actually melted during the flight .
All of the instruments in the aircraft were intact .
It was difficult to get him out .
There were instruments in the aircraft that melted .
And , she didn 't really understand .
Alas , she was not able to understand clearly due to a language barrier .
Indeed , she did not comprehend .
She knew exactly what we were talking about .
Maybe she told everyone else and I wasn 't paying attention at that particular time .
I didn 't hear her when she told everyone else .
I heard everything she said .
I was talking to someone else at the time .
Only lost two , three aircraft while we was there , and , uh , test phase .
A couple of aircraft got lost because of the weather .
A couple of aircraft were lost .
We 've never lost an aircraft .
I need you to do something for me .
I don 't need any help .
It is a big job that I need done .
There is something I need done .
Different , totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies , uh , three times the speed of sound , over 22 , 000 miles an hour .
It flies over 20 , 000 miles an hour .
It only travels 10 , 000 miles an hour .
The jet flies 20 , 000 miles an hour .
It was , uh , which we , uh , had Rudolph Anderson in a , a formulation of three U2 's .
Rudolph Anderson was nowhere to be found , so we only had one U2 's .
Rudolph Anderson was part of three U2 's .
We were blessed to have Rudolph Anderson help with the U2 's .
She was still in there .
She was gone without a trace .
She was still in the vicinity .
We thought she left but she remained .
Also , oh , let me go through this .
I don 't need to deal with that .
I will look through this .
I 'll look through these reports .
But all of a sudden , we was called out to look at what was flying .
We were supposed to look at the flying plane .
We were supposed to look at what was flying .
We were told not to look outside .
He would tear the , the paper up and put it in the sand , ashtray sand , set it on a fire and burn it , and then stir the ashes up like that .
He was too afraid to burn anything so he just flushed it .
He would burn the paper .
He would write a dream on the paper and then burn it .
Um , You need to call Ramona at Concord , mind you she 's at an office , actually she 's in a client , all the way across town , we 're in Monroe , she 's in Concord .
Ramona has lived in Concord all her life .

Ramona is located in Concord .
That 's kind of unique in that I , uh , spent , uh , about 16 years of my career in Special Activities .
I was in Special Activities for years .
I 've never had a job .
My favorite job was in Special Activities .
I think that 's why I remember that .
I didn 't remember it at all .
That 's probably the reason I remembered his name .
That 's probably why I recalled that .
And it makes you feel just awful .
It makes you feel great .
It makes you feel horrible .
You feel better after an hour .
You don 't have to stay there .
You can go home if you want to .
You can leave .
You need to stay in that exact spot !
That was , that was a pretty scary day .
It was a relaxing day .
It was really scary when the tornado came into town .
That day really scared me .
Uh , well it 's , uh , the speeds got faster , faster , and faster until we deployed overseas .
It kept getting faster .
It seemed to take forever .
The speed was making me nervous .
So , well I , uh , anyway , uh , uh , this is the three , uh , U2 pilots that , uh , President Kennedy 's office in Washington with General May .
General May and the pilots had a great time visiting the office .
General May never went to President Kennedy 's office .

But uh , think about it .
I think about it often .
It 's nothing you would want to think about .
It 's something to think about .
They took Joe with them , and my Granny said , she said it was such a sad time in the house because , you know , everybody was missing Joe and they didn 't know what to do .
Everyone in the house was moping because they missed Joe so much .
Everyone was so happy !
Joe died and it was really depressing .
The part was , there was 158 parts to it and we had to break it down put it back together break it down and never make a mistake .
We had to take it apart and reassemble it .
We had to take the jets apart and then put them back together .
We weren 't allowed to touch it at all .
I don 't want to go into the Third SS that 's Third Strategic Support Squadron .
I couldn 't wait to go into the Third SS .
I don 't want to be part of the Third SS .
The Third SS is the worst possible squadron .
It wasn 't nothing but a desert ; there was sagebrush out on the runway .
It was a tropical rainforest .
There was a lot of scrubbby foilage in the area .
There were tumbleweeds blowing across the runway .
He didn 't say a time again , so he just got me over there stressing out , and I really don 't even know when it 's needed .
I was worried because I didn 't know what time .
I was worried that I would miss the show because I didn 't know what time it was .
I wasn 't worried at all , it would happen when it happened .

He is a Greek man who speaks no English .
He is a Greek man .

So anyhow , I call Ramona back because I had a question about , I was like , All right , let me hurry up on with it , and I had a question about something I was doing .
I did not bother to call Ramona .
I never got a chance to ask the question .
I wanted to ask Ramona a question .
Little things like that made a big difference in what I was trying to do .
I didn 't even try to do it .
I was trying to accomplish something .
I was trying to finish my poster for class and the new markers helped .
Well , there 's nobody there to help me .
I 'm not able to do it on my own .
There are plenty of people to help me there .
There isn 't anyone in that place to assist me .
The CIA unloaded the , the film , taken them to the United Nations the next day .
The CIA brought the film to the UN .
The CIA kept the film for themselves .
The CIA thought the UN needed to see the film right away .
I already told him , I tried to explain to him that I was frustrated I didn 't have all the information I needed .
I told him I didn 't want to hear anything else .
I told him I needed more info to decide what to do with the job .

That 's why I didn 't graduate college , but I never , I never read any of the books I was supposed to .
I didn 't finish college .

SHe moved to Texas and never saw her sister again .
She never saw her sister after that .
She saw her sister every day .
So Granny got up , and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there .
Granny stayed on the porch .
Granny walked 100 feet from the house .
Granny walked away from the house .
The story I shall talk about today is about my father and the culture diversities he had when he moved to America .
I don 't want to talk about my parents .
I 'll tell you about my father 's experience as an immigrant .
I 'll tell you what happened when my dad moved here from Mexico .
It was still cultural area but suburbs was still the dominant form .
It was all very urban .
Most of the area was full of cheap houses .
Most of the area was suburbia .
And then I heard him leave , so I 'm still finishing what I had to do .
I am doing what I 'm required to do today .
I 'm doing the important jobs that I was assigned this morning .
I 'm not going to bother doing this stuff .
And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in , and it was right on the edge of Broad Street .
They lived in a white house on Broad Street .
They lived on Broad Street .
They lived on Main street in a tent .
It would not explode without the trigger .
The trigger makes it explode .
The trigger makes the bomb explode . .
There 's no trigger to pull .
And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy , she said , Go home with him ?
They said she couldn 't go anywhere yet
They told her she had to sleep with the man .
They told her to leave with the man .
And our father always told us not to say they are animals .
Our dad said not to call them animals .
Our dad said they were animals .
Our dad said they were creatures , not animals .
I don 't care if you don 't know anything about it .
I know you aren 't obsessed with it .
I think you should change your mind and be very interested in this !
I 'm not worried if you don 't know anything about it .
Even though I don 't see how he could have expected me to have it done .
I don 't understand why he expected me to finish the drawing today
I don 't understand why he thought i would finish it .
I know he knew I wouldn 't finish this tonight .
I never did see , and don 't know yet why , unless it was just ex , ex , expressing the , the , the need to know what you was a doing and whatever .
I didn 't see it .
I didn 't see what the person was doing on Monday .
I saw every bit of it !
They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said , Get your baggage and leave there immediately , and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington .
They told me I should stay home .
They told me to grab my bags .
They told me to pick up by white suitcase .
Come to find out it was a U2 aircraft but we couldn 't , we could not say one word about what it was ; nothing to our wives , kids or anybody .
We couldn 't tell anyone the U2 had landed .
We told everyone all about it .
We weren 't allowed to talk about the U2 .
If , if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit , your hands would go to about five times the size , if you had a decompression .
No changes would occur in your skin .
your hand could change size if it was exposed outside of the suit .
your hand would grow a ton if you were on the moon and you stuck it out of the suit .
Is there any reason why she didn 't tell you ?
I know there 's no reason she wouldn 't tell you .
Why wouldn 't she tell you about it ?
Why wouldn 't she tell you about the baby ?
They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this , this cousin , and they just stayed and he didn 't know how to get back , so he just stayed with them .
He never visited his family .
He stayed in Brooklynn with his family .
He stayed with them in New York .
No , it was just that one time in the morning , and she said that she was going to come back to the office .
She didn 't mention if she was going to return or not .
She said she was going to return later .
She said she 'd come back to the office with lunch .
We didn 't know what a U2 was and nobody knew anything about a U2 .
We didn 't know what the heck a u2 was .
We didn 't know what to call the thing we saw in the air .
We knew all about the U2 !
My grandmother was born in 1910 , she was a little girl .
My grandma was born 10 years after the turn of the century .

So he stayed in Augusta after that ?
Did he remain in Augusta ?

I know he left Augusta immediately .
Anyway it got up to , we had about uh , ah , I don 't remember the numbers .
I don 't remember how many we had .
I don 't remember how many workers we had .
I know the exact numbers for everything
Anyhow , so I finished came home at 6 : 30 today and that was my day .
I decided to come home at lunch and take the rest of the day off .
I didnt do anything significant after 6 : 30 today .
I spent most of the day dealing with a complicated customer billing issue .
And so she sat back down , and , you know , they were still chatting , and they could still see this person , and this person was walking really , really fast .
She kept talking to her coworkers about the guy running away .
She kept talking .
She stayed silent and looked down at her desk .
And , uh , if it surged and just kept surging it would go ' whish , ' and , like it was going to pull your head off .
If there is a surge of electricity , it 's very dangerous to anyone around .
If there is a surge , there is a noise that accompanies it .
It will only surge once .
I don 't have enough information .
I have all the information I could ever need .
I need more information to decide what kind of car to purchase .
I need to gather more information about this thing .
I 'll call you back in about an hour , he says .
He said he would call once he got home .
He said he 'd return the call .
He said they were done speaking .
Of course , they questioned me there , why I went .
They asked me why I had gone there .
They asked why I went to the store .
They asked why I 'd stayed home .
I had to start training in course .
I didn 't need any preparation .
I had to learn how to complete the obstacle course .
I had to start preparing .
Well anyway , I went back to my , my desk .
I refused to sit down again .
I returned to my seat .
I went back and sat down because my boss told me to .
Now that 's how classified it was .
If anyone learned the information , they 'd be jailed .
It was public information .
It was very classified .
They didn 't want to stay captive .
They had been captured at some point but wanted to escape .
They had been detained in relation to a recent robbery .
They were all terrified of being released from custody .
So it took me like , an hour to two hours just to find what I needed .
I found it in just a few seconds .
It took me a long time because the book was really thick and confusing .
It took me a while to find it .
Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers , and brings him back down .
Pilots get tested in altitude chambers .
Pilots have to be tested in altitude chambers about 20 times a month .
The altitude chamber has been discontinued .
And , uh , they moved downtown and , there was , uh , and it 's still like this in Augusta , this big street downtown called Broad Street , and it really was just this broad street in a downtown area .
They left Augusta and went to Atlanta .
They went downtown to the main street .
They went to the street with the most restaurants and bars .
That was my messed up .
I did it without any errors .
I made a mistake when i sent in the forms .
I made a mistake .
She 's like , But you need to look here , look here , she 's gives me like three different places to look in the computer .
She had no idea where to look .
She told me the folders would be on the desktop .

Snake River is filled with snakes .
yeah i have a credit union
I do have a credit union I go to .
I visit my credit union frequently .
What 's a credit union ?
exactly it 's it 's an active state it 's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do any good really i don 't think
I think you have to devote 10 hours a day to be good at it .
I think you need to be devoted to it to do well .
It 's fine if you don 't really take it seriously .
and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us
I just know it will be so boring and not worth changing those that represent us so we should not even try to change .
I think it will be challenging to change our representatives but worthwhile in the end .
We have to make changes to those that represent us .
and they can be very nice too after after they 've been trained
They become hardened and cold once they complete the training .
They change rapidly while undergoing training .
When they undergo training they can be quite pleasant .
and it can go on for ten twenty years i i think this is a little ridiculous
I think it 's crazy that one lawsuit can go on so many years .
I think it 's nuts that it can last so long .
It only lasts a week .
yeah you you must 've had a cordless
Correct the one you had was cordless .
The one you had was definitely a corded version only .
You might have had one with an optional cord .
are you saying the teachers or the parents
Are you saying the students or the teacher 's aide did it ?
Is it the teachers or the parents ?
What are you implying about the parents and the teachers ?
besides i probably would look at something uh maybe a a V six
I am thinking of looking at a V6 .
I think a V6 is the best way to go .
I would never consider a V6 .
well i guess it would i guess so well i don 't know i i i really haven 't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i 'm totally straight would never consider using drugs
I am strongly against drug testing , there is no doubt in my mind about it .
I guess I would be fine with being drug tested .
I think so but I have not gone through my emotions with regards to drug testing .
care about how the national news affects the local area
Concerned about the local places being affected by national news .
I could care less what the national news covers with concerns about our local areas .
The national news outlets make our local places seem backwards .
but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is is what you see down here so it 's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
I don 't dress up when I work at home .
I don 't wear anything other than sweats when I work at home .
I still wear dresses when I 'm working at home because I feel fancier .
yeah there there 's something about having a place to live i don 't know
Having a place to live is a dream come true .
I don 't really care if i have a place to live .
It 's nice to have a place to live .
yeah yeah i you know i i wouldn 't even mind so much if they had a um corporation that is financed
It would be easy to find out if the corporation was financed .
It would make me angry to find out that they had financed the corporation .
It wouldn 't bother me if the corporation was financed .
yeah it 's ours up here we have our rural connections are real bad
The connections around here are sometimes okay .
We do not get good connections here .
We have the best connections around here .
and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i don 't think it 's a chain
I can not stand the Black Eyed Pea .
I might check out the Black Eyed Pea later .
The Black Eyed Pea is likable , I think its corporate .
but on the other hand we 've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of
I Do not eat any kind of meat .
I have ate unusual animals before such as turtle , raccoon and possum .
I have tried many different types of animals for food .
one of the benefits we get of course is travel
Traveling is my favorite part of it .
Traveling is one perk we get .
We don 't get any benefits .
it 's it 's really bad it uh i
I have heard it is not good .
It is horrible .
It 's not bad at all .
yeah it was pretty reasonable
No , I think that is insane and highly irrational .
Yes , it was very acceptable .
Yes , we acknowledge that it was difficult but nonetheless came out pretty well in the end .
so um we usually meet like at my uncle 's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it
We go to the cottage for a couple of days .
We go to the cottage in Minnesota .
We have never been to the cottage .
exactly and i was very flattered until she told me she the company she was with
I do not like the company she is with .
She did not flatter me at all .
She made me feel good until I found out who she was with .
have you read The Firm
Did you read The Firm ?
Have you read The Soft ?
Would you like to borrow my copy of The Firm to read ?
yeah and we just kind of we kept uh kind of uh it was a surprise birthday party for her was what it was
She loved the surprise party .
We didnt do anything for her birthday .
We threw a surprise birthday for her .
i don 't know coming from Texas you 're probably i don 't know i i shouldn 't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
Gun control is probably not popular in Texas .
I don 't think gun control would upset people in Texas .
Texas should have stronger gun control laws .
uh-huh oh she 's great she 's you know she 's a character she 'll sit with anybody she 'll play with anybody
She is willing to sit or play with anybody .
She normally plays poker or blackjack , but will sometimes play scrabble .
She refuses to sit next to anybody who she does not already know .
course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal and sell it just because they can 't they can 't work anymore you know
People will work if they have opportunity .
That might cause crime to increase .
That will cause a decrease in crime .
yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time
Most of their stuff broke at the same time .
None of their stuff broke .
Some of the broken stuff was valuable .
but uh so you like different foods huh
Do you like different types of food ?
I hear you say you don 't like trying new foods .
You must enjoy trying different ethnic foods .
uh-huh how do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local interest news
Do you think that the local newspapers are not interested in what the citizens have to say ?
What do you think about national newspapers and their global coverage ?
What is your opinion on how the papers treat the local news ?
you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didn 't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in sometimes big companies will pay for like education
It would be worth it to work for a larger company if they gave me money for college .
No companies help with education costs no matter how large or small .
Sometimes larger companies help you pay for education .
well why don 't you start because you 've had more time to think about it if you don 't mind
Why don 't you explain your book to us all .
Why don 't you go first .
You should go last because you don 't know anything .
um-hum do you find that you 're uh uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news
Are you happy with network news coverage ?
I guess you don 't ever watch network news .
I think the networks spin the news to make you think what they want you to think .
yeah i don 't yeah well what get 's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
It got voted down because people didn 't want to get out and vote .
It lost by not very many votes .
It passed by a 99 % margin .
oh um no but they do have hay horse races at the Oaklawn tracks
The hay horse races are fun .
There are hay horse races at the tracks at Oaklawn .
There are no races at Oaklawn tracks .
but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they 're not that good
They are not very good in rural areas .
They are really good in urban areas .
They are very good in both urban and rural areas .
right they will go through the slot
They are easy to slide through .
They go in the opening .
They go in the trash .
is it twenty percent interest
Could the interest be more than 20 ?
Is the interest percent 20 ?
There is no interest .
now that 's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor 's got a noisy dog that 's a deterrent because they know that that dog 's going to bark
Robbers don 't like dogs because they are loud and often bite them .
Robbers don 't like dogs .
Robbers know dogs will be quiet soon .

it 's only getting worse exponentially it seems um
It is slowly getting worse .
It seems to be getting worse .
It 's getting better .
and i really hate to lose them but um that 's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i
Having a yard is not all fun and games but I do enjoy it .
I do not wish to lose it but that is what could happen when you own a yard .
When you own your own piece of land you have nothing to lose anymore .
tag them or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself
After they tell you what to do , you go ahead and do it yourself .
They don 't tell you how to do it at all .
They give decent instructions on how to go about it .
not just lawyers but police officers and judges and the whole legal profession in general
It has nothing to do with anyone involved in the legal system .
It 's everyone involved in the legal system .
Most of the legal system is involved , a majority being that of police .

I really don 't even know what I would pick .
I would choose I 'll Fly Away .
I 'll Fly Away is my favorite movie and I watch it weekly .
yeah but i don 't think we 're gonna to do it because it 's uh you can 't get local stations and that 's the news that we 're mostly interested in
The price is pretty good .
We are definitely going to get it to watch our local news .
We don 't want it because we like local news and it doesn 't get local stations .
i 'm afraid that um i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and
Anderson beat out Reagan .
Anderson ran against Reagan as an independent .
There were other independent tickets that ran as well .

She didn 't ask anything , she told him to get out .
She was dressed in white when she asked : Why do you run , then ? .
You 'll return to it at once , and take your crew with you , or else . . . . But Ogle , violent of mien and gesture , interrupted him .
Ogle had a crew .
Ogle let him continue to speak .
Ogle was angry .
Well , well , maybe he 'll not find me quite so easy to grasp as he imagines .
He has never imagined grasping me .
He thinks grabbing me will be really simple .
I may not be as easy to grab as he thinks .
Don 't think I accept it willingly .
I accept it willingly .
I am not willing to accept it , but I could be convinced .
I don 't accept it willingly .
A murderer--I ? he said at last .
After a pause he said a murderer , I .
He hadn 't murdered anyone .
Immediately he said , A murderer , I .
Thoughtfully he stroked his golden beard .
He had a beard that was a gold color .
He had been growing his beard for years .
His face was clean-shaven .
It was she now who was on her defence , her voice quivering with indignation .
The woman had had enough of their bad behavior .
The woman was angry and defensive .
The woman was so delighted that she was speechless !
What better way ? he demanded .
He did not ask any questions , since he knew he had picked the best way .
He wanted to know if there was a better way .
He was convinced that he had chosen the best way .
He did not trouble to rise , not even when Lord Julian , obeying the instincts of finer breeding , set him the example .
He rose promptly , and proceeded to pull Lord Julian up to his feet .
He was feeling very tired , so he did not stand up .
Lord Julian rose , showing good manners , but he did not bother standing .
Life can be infernally complex , he sighed .
He let out a sign of resignation .
He remained silent as he complained about the simplicity of life .
Life is infernally complicated because of the many interactions one might have .
Wolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain I 'll see Colonel Bishop in hell or ever I lies to for him . And he spat , presumably for purposes of emphasis .
Colonel Bishop has done something to make Wolverstone his enemy .
He spit on the ground in an effort to emphasize his point .
Wolverstone and Colonel Bishop were close friends .
I . . . I believe that he has , said Calverley , between doubt and suspicion .
Calverly responded in a way that made him seem like he was on-the-fence about something .
Calverly was only indecisive in his answer because he did not know all of the facts .
Cleverly spoke with clear decisiveness , knowing that he has with certainty .
And though he should dare attempt it , be sure that his own officers will not dare to do other than oppose him .
He has his own officers .
He is alone and has no officers .
His officers respect him .
Your resolve delivered me from a horrible danger , she admitted .
She did not want him to help her , though was grateful anyway .
She had told him that resolve was what it took to keep her away from peril .
The resolve did not protect her at all from any dangers .
It is an honourable service .
It is a distinguished and eminent service .
It is an honorable service because it 's about saving lives .
It isn 't an honorable service at all , it 's very embarrassing !
You 're not very civil , sir , as I have already noticed .
The man is acting uncivilized .
The man is calm and reasonable .
They are having a conversation .
Wait ! He swung back to face the Captain , who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling , a trifle wistfully .
He had heard some exciting news .
He was looking away from the Captain and then turned around to see him .
The Captain was angry .
He looked up in surprise , and then sat conning her with brooding glance .
He kept his eyes down looking at the ground .
He was surprised by her .
She was braver than he expected .
But Pitt , although he shared it , was prompt to obey .
Pitt completely ignored what was asked of him .
Pitt is the name of a dog that is very obedient .
Pitt quickly followed the order .
He had been a fortnight in Port Royal , his ship virtually a unit now in the Jamaica squadron .
He had never been to Port Royal .
He spent 2 weeks in Port Royal .
He was doing repairs on his ship .
If you will go below , and get your gear and your woman , you shall presently be sent aboard one of the ships of the fleet . He pointed to the boat as he spoke .
The man was the captain of one of the ships .
There was a fleet of ships .
There were no ships in sight .
There 's a thorn or two left on me . And with a laugh Blood departed to his cabin .
Blood had been inside his cabin .
Blood was laughing because he was joyful .
Blood was scowling .
Believe me , I am very grateful .
I am definitely ungrateful to you .
I am grateful because you had done a lot for me .
One is certainly grateful .
We went about , and it 's been a race ever since .
It has always been a contest ever since we went about .
The race had begun ever since we were four .
There was never any race to begin with .
That was in Bridgetown on the night of the Spanish raid .
People were killed in the Spanish raid .
The Spanish raid was done at night .
There was never a raid on Bridgetown .
Blood broke the seal , and read .
Blood is a man .
The seal remained unbroken .
The seal was broken .
In that garden 's main avenue , that was fringed with palm and sandalwood , he had caught sight of Miss Bishop alone .
Miss Bishop was alone in the garden .
Miss Bishop went to the garden in order to contemplate her life .
There was absolutely no one at the garden whatsoever .
Mine is the safe and easy way .
My way is the most difficult .
Someone else 's way is difficult .
There is a way that is safe and easy .
Her presence at this moment , and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone , was embarrassing .
She quickly fled the scene in order to avoid further scrutiny .
The fact that she was here after the fight with Wolverstone was considered an embarrassment .
Wolverstone never got into a dispute with her .
And who the devil may you be ? he exploded at last .
He had suddenly asked a question as to who you may be .
He quietly murmured to himself the whole time .
The person was actually the devil himself .
Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship 's voice .
As the lordship , he showed no mercy to his subjects .
His lordship spoke calmly to all giving the impression of a warm and gentle person .
The Lord 's voice felt both distant and chilling
Steady , Old Wolf ! Steady ! Captain Blood admonished him .
As he is experienced , Captain Blood helped boost morale amongst his crew members .
Captain Blood yelled to Old Wolf .
Let go ! Captain Blood yelled to Old Wolf .
Out of the tail of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was ascending the companion .
He has only one eye .
He has three eyes .
He only has a left eye .
No . Blood closed his telescope .
The blood came from a person 's eye as they had looked into the telescope .
There was blood around the telescope .
There was no sign of blood anywhere near the telescope .
And that was practically the end of the matter .
The matter had been resolved .
The matter remains unresolved .
The solution to the matter was more or less there .
‘ Swounds ! Perhaps you 'll explain yourself ? Whither has Wolverstone gone ?
I want you to explain yourself ! I know you know where Wolverstone is .
Wolverstone is right here . No explanation needed .
You should explain yourself ! What happened to Wolverstone ?
Since when have you commanded on the main deck , Ogle ? I take my orders from the Captain .
Ogle had attempted to give orders as though he were the Captain .
The Captain of the ship was feeling rather ill .
There was no one on the ship to give orders .
There 's no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk .
The ship will sink unless the crew acts fast .
There is a way for them to sink .
They can not possibly sink in any circumstance .
But Wolverstone would not stop .
The Wolverstone completely haulted .
The Wolverstone did not come to an end .
The Wolverstone was part of an elaborate ploy .
He beheld himself to be as the dog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive shadow .
He never desired to be anything like that dog in that one fable .
The fable is as old as time .
There was once a story about a dog and a delusive shadow .
If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission , the mistake is not mine .
There might have been an error to give Captain Blood his commission .
There was no mistake in providing Captain Blood with his commission .
There was the potential for error as the accountant was recently fired .
Besides , how could their staying have helped me ? And as Pitt did not answer him : Ye see ? he said , and shrugged .
He had moved his shoulders in a sign of acceptance .
He told them that he could see it but it was not a big deal in the end .
It was clear that staying could have helped me , so no question was ever posed .
But it 'll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you .
He wants to see you about the Old Bear and not about the Old Wolf .
He wants to see you about the Old Wolf .
He wants to see you today about the Old Wolf .
I can 't think that it would make the least difference if he did , said his lordship gravely .
His choice was between buying 12 chickens or 3 oxen .
His lordship believed that either choice would have had a substantial impact .
Whether or not he chose to act , his lordship did not believe it would have changed anything .
Your words have rankled with him .
He did not like what you said .
He is going to punish you for those words .
He really enjoyed what you said .
England 's , she corrected him in reproof .
He was wrong and she said nothing .
She fixed his issue .
She was always tasked with correcting him .
But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused .
Julian looked serious but was actually amused .
Julian thought the situation was funny .
Julian was being clear about his feelings .
I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King 's commission to such a man as this against all my counsels .
The lordship just took my advice and carried his acts accordingly .
While the lordship was very smart , his grave mistake of not listening to my counsel will spell the end of the kingdom .
Your lordship has chosen to act in a manner against my advice .
Ah , now , can 't ye , indeed ? he cried .
He asked because he was rather shocked about the whole situation .
He had shouted a question .
He never posed a question as he remained silent .
Some o ' them dawcocks may believe that tale . He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist , whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle .
People from the forecastle were joining the men in the waist .
Some people believed the tale that the princess had been eaten by a dragon .
The ranks of men were dwindling , as everyone headed towards the forecastle for dinner .
If anything it increased his excitement .
It decreased his excitement .
It made him more excited than he had ever been .
It made him more excited .
Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence , we 'll hang the doxy first and fight for it after .
There was no way of knowing if the boat would still move forward .
There was nothing able to slow down the ship .
We will attempt to battle over it , once we begin to sail .
Good-day to you , sir , Blood hailed him pleasantly .
Blood said nothing to the man he encountered .
Blood wished the man a good day .
The man was old .
Don 't you , by God ! And what else do you call this ? But as His Majesty 's Deputy-Governor of Jamaica , I 'll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way .
A person who is shouting decides to fix someone else 's mistake .
His Majesty 's Deputy-Governer of Jamaica is already dead .
One man told the other that he had done his work perfectly and that any mistakes were his own fault .
So ye 've come , the Deputy-Governor hailed him , and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill-humoured import .
I was expecting your arrival said the Deputy-Governor .
The Deputy-Governor was not necessarily expecting him , though greeted him anyways .
There was some remorse when the Deputy-Governor had waved hello .
That girl , there . He flung out a bare arm to point to her .
He didn 't have any arms so he asked someone else to point to the girl .
He pointed at the girl .
The girl had blonde hair .
Aye , said Ogle , that is true . But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the course .
Ogle never mentioned anyone who disliked the current course .
Some did not like the idea of the current course and refuted it , explicitly .
The course was full of territory that was left unexplored and was , therefore , very dangerous .
What I think of you can be a very little matter to you , sir . This was a disarming stroke .
It doesn 't matter what I think of you .
You might care what I think about you .
You should definitely care about what I think of you .
I 'll not be bubbled by what Wolverstone has said .
As many said before , Wolverstone was a simple man with few words .
I felt very bubbled by the words of Wolverstone .
Wolverstone had said something that did not make one feel bubbled .
About him in the waist , where all last night had been so peaceful , there was a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men .
The night was considered restful though , there was a lot of commotion later on .
The night was extremely busy as the streets were packed with people .
This evening was busier than usual because of an event being hosted .
I cannot think why you should trouble to put yourself on your defence , she discouraged him .
Encouraging this , she had found many reasons as to why one would trouble themselves to defend you .
She had discouraged any form of defense that was applicable to you .
The defense that was put forth by her was insufficient .
Bid them take in sail , Jeremy , he said quietly .
He spoke with a soft tone .
Jeremy shouted very loudly to get their attention .
Jeremy was a pirate for his entire life .
You 'll not go ? he said , between question and assertion .
Are you not going ? He asked .
Please do not go ! He begged .
Why are you not leaving right now ? He grunted .
He sought comfort in a line on the open page before him : levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas . Sought it , but hardly found it .
He found little safety through reading the passage on the page .
The language described in the pages are of a language native to the land .
There was some foreign language in the pages before him .
For myself , I am entirely of Wolverstone 's opinion .
I admit that I have disagreed with Wolverstone before .
I completely side with Wolverstone on this matter .
I have never heard of a person called Wolverstone .
See it manned for me .
It should be controlled by someone .
See that no one mans it for me .
The boat 's cannons were currently unmanned .
He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood , and saluted him , as was his due , but the smile that lifted the officer 's stiff mostachios was grimly sardonic .
Captain Blood was nowhere to be found .
He could see Captain Blood .
The officer had a mustache .
Ha ! Wolverstone vented an ejaculation of sneering mirth .
Wolverstone did not laugh .
Wolverstone laughed .
Wolverstone thought that was funny .
